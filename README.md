# Coin-Collecting-game
Coin collecting game done with pygame library. 

Start screen added.
Changed robot, coins, monsters to Rect classes instead of scratch-built ones.
Adopted colliderect() instead of messy looking comparisons of height + width values for collision.

To do:
Ending screen, transfer new game to that?
Some functionality to robot, shooting, speed boost?
